#DealNoDeal

<p>This program is a simplified version of "Deal or No-Deal". The game, uses 10 cases (=boxes) instead of original 26 cases.</p>
<p>When the game starts, a user should pick his/her case. Then, the program will ask the user to select the initial three cases. After that, the program presents an offer to the user. In the game, the program should make the average of remaining hidden cases as an offer value.</p>
<p>If the user accepts the offer (= “Deal”), your program should finish. If the user decides the “No Deal” option, your program asks the user to pick two cases.
After selecting two cases, the user should decide “Deal” or “No Deal” again. If the user denies the offer again, your program should ask the user to pick one case. And the game will continue in this way.
